This is a template to creating a new CHX Lazarus project.

Steps:

  1. Copy this directory content where you want to store the new project.  
  3. CHXPas folder only have the basic units to run an empty form. Maybe, you will want to git clone actual [CHXPas](https://github.com/Chixpy/CHXPas) or if you want to use git with the project add it as submodule.
  3. Rename project file and main form files using 'Save As...' menu option. Don't do manually. Delete main project files 'NewCHX.XXX' manually.
  4. Rename Project Title, Name, Description in Project Options (Shift + Ctrl + F11)
