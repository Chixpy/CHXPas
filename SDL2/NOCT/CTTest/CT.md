# The Coding Train Challenges

Basically Processing code is ported "as is", althougt it is not very optimized
or Pascal friendly. The main changes are:

  - Show/Draw methods in classes are moved to main OnDraw call.
  - No Garbage Collector, so reserved dinamicmemory and objects are freed.

Maybe some day a better "Pascalized" version of the programs and the classes 
will be done and ucSDL2Engine will evolve.

## Done / Skipped

| CT003 | The Snake Game |
| CT004 | Purple Rain |
| CT005 | Space Invaders |
| CT006 | Mitosis Simulation |
  
## Skipped

Reasons to skip:

| # | Reason | Name |
|---:|:--:|:---|
| CT002 | 3D | Menger Sponge Fractal |
| CT007 | PM | Solar System (2D) |
| CT008 | 3D | Solar System (3D) |
| CT009 | 3D | Solar System (3D) with textures |
 
 - 3D: Not done now because needs 3D engine, to be done with OpenGL/Vulkan 
    setup.
  - PM: Not done because Processing coordinate Matrix manipulations (pushMatrix).
    They change the coordinate system in a stack and apply to make relative
    translations and rotations.
