# CHXPas
Some common units used in my other project:

  - [Emuteca](https://github.com/chixpy/emuteca)
  - [Comicteca](https://github.com/Chixpy/Comicteca)
  - [LNSCompFE](https://github.com/Chixpy/LNSCompFE)
  - And many others not uploaded to GitHub
  
Here also there are some code that maybe in the future will be separated in
their own project:

  - (Tests/CTC folder)(https://github.com/Chixpy/CHXPas/tree/master/Tests/CTC): Pascal implementation of Daniel Shiffman's The Coding Train Challenges while I'm implementing a basic SDL Engine... (Emuteca SDL is still far away...)
